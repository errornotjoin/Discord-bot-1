Hello, this is a discord bot in Python and some SQL, too.

To start:
You need to install MySQL and Discord on your IDE. You can do this by 
pip3/python3 install MySQL
pip3/python install discord
You will need to install Xammp or something like that to work with MySQL.
You will need to create a file called the_discord_items. This is where you put your discord bot API Key and other discord information.n
